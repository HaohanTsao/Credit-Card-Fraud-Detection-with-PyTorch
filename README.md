# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-with-PyTorch
We chose the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from a data science competition platform as the case study for our practice implementation.

## Sample Dataset
Data Source: [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

For the purpose of computational efficiency in this exercise, we sampled only 20% of the data, comprising around 56,962 transaction records.
